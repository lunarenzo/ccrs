2. Implement client-side transaction for number generation
3. Update report creation workflow to assign blotter numbers
4. Add blotter number display to all report views
5. Concurrent access testing and validation

### **T-1.3: Desk Officer Role & Portal**
```typescript
// Extended user roles
type UserRole = 'citizen' | 'desk_officer' | 'investigator' | 'supervisor' | 'admin';

// New Firestore rules for desk officer access
match /reports/{reportId} {
  // Desk officers can validate pending reports
  allow update: if hasRole('desk_officer') && 
                resource.data.status == 'pending' &&
                request.resource.data.status in ['validated', 'rejected'];
}
```

**Implementation Steps:**
1. Add `desk_officer` role to Firebase Auth custom claims
2. Create new `/desk` route in admin application
3. Implement Desk Officer dashboard with validation queue
