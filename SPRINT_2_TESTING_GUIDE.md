## üß™ **Testing Scenarios**

### **Test 1: Crime Classification System**
**Location:** Admin Dashboard (Desk Officer Portal)  
**Prerequisites:** Crime categories seeded in Firestore

**Steps:**
1. Navigate to Desk Officer portal
2. Select a pending report for validation
3. Test crime classification dropdown:
   - Verify 25+ crime categories load
   - Test search functionality
   - Verify RPC and Special Laws grouping
   - Test IndexedDB caching (network tab)
4. Assign crime classification and save
5. Verify Firestore update with classification

**Expected Results:**
- [ ] All 25 crime categories displayed
- [ ] Search filters work correctly
- [ ] Categories grouped by RPC/Special Laws
- [ ] IndexedDB cache reduces Firestore reads
- [ ] Classification saves to report document

### **Test 2: Enhanced Status Transitions**
**Location:** Police App & Admin Dashboard  
**Prerequisites:** Reports in various status states

**Steps:**
1. Test investigator status transitions:
   - `assigned` ‚Üí `accepted`
   - `accepted` ‚Üí `responding`
   - `responding` ‚Üí `investigating`
   - `investigating` ‚Üí `resolved`
2. Test invalid transitions (should be blocked):
   - `pending` ‚Üí `investigating` (invalid)
   - `resolved` ‚Üí `responding` (invalid)
3. Verify status history tracking:
   - Each transition logged with timestamp
   - Officer details recorded
   - Notes required for transitions

**Expected Results:**
- [ ] Valid transitions succeed with proper validation
- [ ] Invalid transitions blocked with error messages
- [ ] Status history properly maintained
- [ ] Role-based permissions enforced
- [ ] Required notes validated

### **Test 3: IRF Auto-Generation System**
**Location:** Admin Dashboard (Desk Officer Portal)  
**Prerequisites:** Validated reports with blotter numbers

**Steps:**
1. Open Desk Officer portal
2. Select a validated report
3. Click "Generate IRF" button
4. Fill in IRF Generation Modal:
   - Police station information
   - Officer details
   - Reporting person information
   - Enable PDF generation
5. Generate IRF document
6. Verify PDF creation and download
7. Check Firebase Storage for uploaded PDF
8. Verify report updated with IRF data

**Expected Results:**
- [ ] IRF modal opens with auto-populated data
- [ ] Officer can edit/complete missing fields
- [ ] PDF generates with PNP-compliant formatting
- [ ] PDF uploads to Firebase Storage successfully
- [ ] Download link works correctly
- [ ] Report document updated with IRF reference
- [ ] Professional formatting matches official PNP form

### **Test 4: Firestore Security Rules**
**Location:** Browser Developer Console  
**Prerequisites:** Test users with different roles

**Steps:**
1. Test crime categories access:
   - Authenticated users can read
   - Only admins/supervisors can write
2. Test IRF templates access:
   - Desk officers can read
   - Only admins can write
3. Test report status transitions:
   - Role-based transition permissions
   - Invalid status jumps blocked
4. Test approval queue (when implemented)

**Expected Results:**
- [ ] Proper read/write permissions enforced
- [ ] Role-based access control working
- [ ] Security rules block unauthorized actions
- [ ] Error messages are user-friendly

## üîß **Manual Testing Commands**

### **Deploy Firestore Rules**
```bash
cd C:\Users\nicos\september282025
firebase deploy --only firestore:rules
```

### **Check Firebase Status**

firebase deploy --only firestore:rules
```

### **Issue: Crime Categories Not Loading**
**Solution:** Check if categories are seeded in Firestore
```javascript
// Verify in Firebase Console -> Firestore -> crimeCategories collection
```

### **Issue: IRF PDF Generation Fails**
**Solution:** Check jsPDF library installation and Firebase Storage rules
```bash
npm install jspdf
```

### **Issue: Status Transitions Blocked**
**Solution:** Verify user role and transition validity
```javascript
// Check user custom claims in Firebase Auth
```
